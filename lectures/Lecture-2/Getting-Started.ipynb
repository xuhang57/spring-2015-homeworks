As expected, this will be a code-intensive course. We have chosen [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the language to work with, since it allows for fast prototyping and is supported by a great variety of scientific (and, specifically, data related) libraries. For a quick introduction to Python, you can check [Lecture 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dataminingapp/dataminingapp-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-1/Intro%20to%20Python.ipynb)."

      "Systems like *git* allow us to move work between any two repositories. In practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it on the web rather than on someone's laptop. Most programmers use hosting services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) to hold those master copies. For the purpose of our course, we will be using [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the course material. You will also submit your homeworks through this platform. Next, we will cover how you can fork and clone the course's repository and how to submit your solutions to the homework. For more information on how to create your own repository on GitHub and upload code to it, please see the tutorial by [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-collab.html)."
